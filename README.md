# Fitbit Time Series Project

## About the Project
### Goals
- Clean the current data set. Document the code that take the original source to the workable data.
- Summarize the data.
- Draw conclusions on the individual who wore the fitness tracker
- Make predictions on the two weeks of missing data
### Background
Scenario:
>A man wearing a lab coat and a worried expression bursts into your office.
>
>"I need help!" he says. "I mixed up the labels and have one extra!"
>
>Before you can ask what he has an extra of, he throws a USB thumb drive in your direction. As you wonder who still uses thumb drives, the man in the lab coat rushes back out the door.
>
>"Oh, and I need to know what the missing next 2 weeks will look like too" he says on his way out.
>
>Before you can think of a question to ask, he's out of sight.
>
>You open up the files on the drive and find the data.
>
>Even though you just started a week ago, as a data scientist for Big Research Co., you know several things:
>
>- Your company is running multiple different experiments: drug trials, testing different fitness equipment, and some "very ethical" human experimentation.
>- Everyone in every experiment wears a fitbit.
>- No one seems to have time for smalltalk.
>- Everyone on staff has a fitbit.
>
>It's a pretty good guess that this data comes from somebody's fitbit, but you don't know who it belongs to, it could be from someone participating in a research experiment, or a staff member just going about their days.


### Deliverables
- A notebook containing my analysis
- Predictions for the missing two weeks worth of data in a separate csv file.
- The above information distilled into two slides that can be shared with a general audience. Include at least one visualization, and make sure that the visualization is clearly labeled.
